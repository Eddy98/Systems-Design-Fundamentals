# Systems-Design-Fundamentals

## Intro

Naturally, SD interviews will be vague. It is important to investigate further into a question.

#### Categories

- Underlying/Foundational systems knowledge
- Key characteristics of systems - things that you might want the system to have - eg. redundancy, availability, etc
- Actual components - more tangible things, such as load balancer, caches, etc
- Tech - eg. redux, AWS, etc

## Client-Server Model

Notes: Like the foundation of the modern internet, how computers speak to one another

Client - Requests data to a server

Server - Listens to a client, and sends data
